# Introducing Webpack

The ES6 module syntax is a useful way to import external dependencies into a module, guaranteeing that all our scripts
are loaded in the correct order. However it is not natively supported in browsers. To get around this, there are a 
number of build tools that allow us to **bundle** our JavaScript modules so that they can be consumed within a browser 
environment:

- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)

We're going to look at Webpack.
